# Gravitational Loop
 
I tried to make it a known hyper-casual game, because I don't think I'm yet at the level of knowledge to make a game with my own original idea.

In this way, I better understood the working mechanism of popular games.

I think this game I'm trying to make will inspire me in my next projects.
